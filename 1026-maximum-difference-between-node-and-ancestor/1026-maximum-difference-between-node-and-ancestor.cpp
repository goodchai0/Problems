	     Given Example - 1 in Question :
		 all paths or Sequences given below :
		 
		* 		 8->3->1            (mx = 8 , mi = 1)  ==> diff = mx - mi = 8 - 1 = 7
		* 		 8->3->6->4         (mx = 8 , mi = 3)  ==> diff = mx - mi = 8 - 3 = 5
		* 		 8->3->6->7         (mx = 8 , mi = 3)  ==> diff = mx - mi = 8 - 3 = 5
		* 		 8->10->14->13      (mx = 14, mi = 8)  ==> diff = mx - mi = 14 - 8 = 6
	     
		 maximum of all the "diff" values is the required answer.
		 so answer is diff = 7.
